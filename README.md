So hello friends how are you ? Hope you are doing well.

I have created this week just mini project. I am still watching Angelina Course and I have just practice auto layout with the help of UiStack View and how to embeded in project.
I learn again how to do pinining and what is constraint.

Leading means left side of the componenet.
Trailing means right side of component.

With the help of UiStack view it is so easy to implement the complex layout so easily. I have started learning SwiftUi but I think so it's important to brush up the basic and keep practicising  the storyboard and swift.
